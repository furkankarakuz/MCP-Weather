# MCP-Weather üå¶Ô∏è

This project provides a server built with the Model Completion Protocol (MCP), designed to deliver up-to-date weather information in response to real-time queries. By integrating the OpenWeather API, the server allows AI models to fetch accurate weather data based on location input and return structured responses. This tool enables enhanced interaction between language models and live environmental data sources.

## üîç What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source protocol that enables AI models to securely connect to various data sources and applications. In other words, it acts as a kind of "connection protocol." Developed by Anthropic, MCP allows AI agents to access, interact with, and utilize your files, databases, applications, and other tools.
